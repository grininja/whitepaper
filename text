Go stands out as a compelling choice compared to C++, Java, and Python. While C++ offers unmatched raw speed, its complexity and manual memory management can be a burden. Java boasts a mature ecosystem and platform independence, but its performance lags behind compiled languages like Go. Python shines with its ease of use, but its execution speed and limitations with true multithreading make it less suitable for system programming tasks like cache development. Go bridges the gap by offering excellent performance due to compiled code, strong concurrency features for handling multiple requests, and automatic garbage collection that simplifies development. Furthermore, Go's clean syntax and growing ecosystem make it an attractive choice for code maintainability and future potential. While other languages have their strengths, Go's combination of performance, developer experience, and ease of use make it a clear winner for building a high-quality in-memory cache library.
